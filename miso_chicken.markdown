# Miso Chicken

## Introduction

This is a super-simple, delicious recipe that I made up to make a boring chicken breast really succulent and tasty. If you're one of those people who think that a chicken breast is some sort of boring lump of protein, then this might help convince you otherwise. Or not. Whatever.

You could probably try this with other cuts of chicken, but for me slimy chicken skins are one of the most heinous culinary crimes. So do yourself a favour and skin the chicken first. Or don't if you're a freak and like slimy things in your mouth. You're probably the kind of person that likes boiled okra too. We probably can't be friends.

## Ingredients

* A couple of sachets of miso soup paste
* Some oyster mushrooms (other mushrooms will probably work fine)
* A chicken breast
* Salt
* Soy sauce
* Toasted sesame oil

## Method

Put about a 2cm worth of water in the bottom of a pressure cooker.

Add the miso paste and give it a stir.

Add the mushrooms and place the chicken breast on top.

Splash in some dark soy sauce and sprinkle over some salt. I love salty stuff, but if you don't, maybe just use the soy.

Bring the liquid up to the boil on your biggest hob ring. Put the pressure cooker lid on and lock it, setting the pressure to the highest setting.

Once the indicator shows you that the it's up to pressure, transfer to the smallest gas ring on the lowest heat.

Set your timer for 30-35 minutes depending on how big the chicken breast is.

When the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to drop naturally. If you forcibly lower the pressure by opening the vent, you may cause the breast to disintegrate.

Once the pressure has dropped, open the pressure cooker and carefully remove the chicken breast. It will be *very* succulent and will fall apart at the slightest pressure.

If you like, carefully brush over some olive oil and fry the smooth side on a very hot griddle. This will give you the Maillard reactions that produce still deeper flavour. Or, if you can't be arsed with that, you can just serve the whole thing as it is in a deepish bowl, chicken on top.

It would probably work with some corriander or whatever, but I definitely recommend giving it a little bit of toasted sesame oil.

Enjoy.
