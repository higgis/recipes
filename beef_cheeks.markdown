# Beef Cheek Stew

## Introduction

This is an incredibly meaty stew made with one of my favourite cuts of beef. Serve it with wet polenta or mashed potato, and braised greens.

## Ingredients

These quantities are for four people. Scale them up as necessary. Anyway, one cheek per person.

4 x ox cheeks (beef cheeks are always called ox cheeks for some reason)  
2 x 6 inch lengths of bone marrow, cut in half lengthways (get your butcher to do this for you)  
2 x tins of tomatoes  
Half a bottle of decent red wine  
1 x star anise  
3 x bay leaves  
2 x red onion  
Chicken or beef stock  

## Method

Sear the cheeks on both sides in some olive oil over a high heat. This is to develop flavour, so don't skip this step.

Sweat off the chopped onions in a pressure cooker in a small amount of olive oil. Add the cheeks as you sear them.

Pour in the tomatoes and give everything a good stir. Don't let the onions settle or they'll burn.

Now pour in the red wine and stock. You want the meat to be well covered with what seems like a small excess of liquid.

Tie the star anise in a small bit of muslin - this makes it easy to extract it later so that you don't end up with a nasty woody chewy bit on the plates.

Finally, add the bay leaves and season to taste. Under do the salt at this stage; you can always correct it later.

Now, bring the whole thing to the boil with the pressure cooker lid on, set to maximum pressure. 

When the pressure cooker is up to pressure, turn the heat to the lowest you can, even moving it onto the smallest burner. Make sure that the pressure doesn't drop though.

Now, leave the pressure cooker to work its magic for two hours.

When the cooking time is up, release the pressure valve and when it's safe open the lid. The cheeks will have come apart and be incredibly tender. Remove the bay leaves and star anise and discard.

If it hasn't come out already, scrape the bone marrow out of the bones and mix in with the stew. Discard the bones. As you mix, break down the cheeks further so that the whole thing is amalgamated.

Taste and, if necessary, correct the seasoning.

Serve with a wet polenta (my favourite, although many people seem not to like it) and some greens quickly braised in white wine. If you don't like polenta, then mashed potato is a fine substitute.
